# ZeldaMap
A side project about making an interactive map called "The Legend of Zelda : Tears of The King"

The website itself using the drivetoWeb to build, 
So it's relatively slow to load things, 
However it will be free!!
The Website: [Click here](https://ssyezzh0fvqszrhnjny0xw.on.drv.tw/zeldamap/)

The web connect to amazon dynamoDB to process the username and password, 
Other than that, I just use html, js and css to build it.
