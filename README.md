# ZeldaMap
A side project about making an interactive map called "The Legend of Zelda : Tears of The King"

The whole project divide into two version:

* Local version:

    **How to Use:** Double-click the "index.html" file in the folder, the checked item will be record in html localstorage, please ignore the login part or any identity recognize. (The complete button and uncomplete button will not be initialize to right status although you can directly click the hide completeness to hide them, you can also click the reload button next to the two buttons, it will check the records and update it in correct status.)
* Web version:

    The website will be in [here](https://ssyezzh0fvqszrhnjny0xw.on.drv.tw/zeldamap/).

    I use dynamoDB to do the account verificatino procedure.
    Other than that, all the website is built on only JS, HTML and CSS.

    The website itself using the "DriveToWeb" service, it's basically using your own google drive as a web server. So it might be a little bit slow when loading the resource. However, it's totally free and is the most appropriate choice to present my side project.
